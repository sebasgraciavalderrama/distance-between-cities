# distance-between-cities
My solution on calculating the distance between two cities using the Haversine formula (latitude and longitude)

To calculate the distance I used the package Haversine module (pip install haversine) and a formula found from a [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29545704/fast-haversine-approximation-python-pandas)
.
